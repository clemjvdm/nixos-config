# NixOS config
NixOS / home-manager configuration for my personal computer.

## Using the configuration
First install NixOS, either with the minimal or GUI installer, by following the steps on the NixOS docs. Before running `nixos-install` make sure to add 'git' to the list of packages to install in 'configuration.nix'.

With git installed, clone this repo anywhere on your computer: 

```git clone https://github.com/clemjvdm/nixos-config.git``` 

The autogenerated 'hardware-configuration.nix' needs to be in 'nixos-config/nixos' to work, so copy it there:

```cp /etc/nixos/hardware-configuration.nix nixos-config/nixos/```.

Now you are ready to rebuild the system with: 

```sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake .#default```

## ISO installer
An ISO can be generated to go through the NixOS installation with the configuration already in place. This is not recommended since this ISO as of now has a broken font and doesn't really provide useful installation tools. To go through the installation with a GUI please just use one of the installers on the NixOS website. Such an ISO may be useful in the future if I decide to improve it.

To build the ISO use the following command:

```nix build .#nixosConfigurations.live.config.system.build.isoImage```

# Todo

- [ ] create script to autogenerate `setup.nix` file (look through all modules to find custom options)
- [x] better network manager
- [ ] fix xfconf keymaps (including switching workspaces)
- [ ] add setup settings
- [ ] improve mousepad configuration
- [ ] battery life optimization
- [ ] check if amdgpu driver/kernel option is needed
